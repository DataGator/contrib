Developer Resource of the ``DataGator`` Project
===============================================

The ``DataGator`` project aims to realize the crowd-source data analytics platform as envisioned by the `Frederick S. Pardee Center for International Futures <http://pardee.du.edu>`_ (abbr. `Pardee`) at the University of Denver.
Once evolved to its full-fledged form, ``DataGator`` will serve as a collaboration tool for sharing, cleansing, and augmenting data sets among an online research community, which gears up political science studies with data science methodologies including exploration, visualization, and quantitative analytics.
This repository collects developer resources including specification documents, sample data, and code snippets for prospective contributors of the ``DataGator`` project.
