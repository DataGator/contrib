Resource for ``DataGator`` Contributors
---------------------------------------

The ``DataGator`` project aims to realize the crowd-source data analytics platform as envisioned by the `Frederick S. Pardee Center for International Futures <http://pardee.du.edu>`_ (abbr. `Pardee`) at the University of Denver.
Once evolved to its full-fledged form, ``DataGator`` will serve as a collaboration tool for sharing, cleansing, and augmenting data sets among an online research community, which gears up domain-specific studies with data science methodologies including exploration, visualization, and quantitative analytics.
This repository collects public resources including specification documents, sample data, and code snippets for prospective contributors of the ``DataGator`` project.
